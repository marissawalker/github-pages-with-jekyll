# About me
I am a postoctoral researcher at Cal State Fullerton, specializing in gravitational-wave astrophysics.

## Gravitational waves
Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime!

Gravitational waves first captured my attention when I was an undergraduate student studying physics.
Black holes! Neutron stars! 

## My research focus

We need exquisitely precise detectors to be able to see gravitational waves from distant objects. 
It also helps to know what we are looking for.
My research targets both of these areas:

* Gravitational-wave detectors
* Theoretical models of the signals produced by black holes crashing together
